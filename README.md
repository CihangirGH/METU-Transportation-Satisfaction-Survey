# METU-Transportation-Satisfaction-Survey
METU Students Satisfaction with Transportation within and to METU Campus

Middle East Technical University features one of the largest university campuses in Turkey where departmental integration within a single location makes internal travel a vital component of student life. This research investigates how daily transportation affects students mental states and overall campus satisfaction through an analysis of reliability and safety. The study utilized survey data from 237 valid responses representing various academic levels and departments to assess travel habits and preferences.

Methodology and Data Privacy: The research employed statistical methods including the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test to identify differences in satisfaction across campus demographics. In compliance with data protection standards and to ensure participant privacy the raw survey data and individual responses are not shared publicly. All data used for this project was handled anonymously and no personally identifiable information was collected or retained. The analysis focused on identifying significant trends while strictly maintaining the confidentiality of the student participants.

Travel Preferences and Reliability: Analysis of preference rankings showed that walking is the most preferred method for within-campus travel while the subway is the primary choice for commuting to and from the campus. Despite the perceived reliability of the subway in isolation the overall commute remains challenging due to difficulties in last-mile connectivity between the subway station and final destinations. These connectivity gaps contribute significantly to time-planning difficulties and lower overall satisfaction scores among the student body.

Safety Perceptions and Demographics: Perceptions of safety vary greatly across transportation modes and student demographics. Walking is consistently rated as the safest option whereas taxi services are perceived as the least safe. Significant gender-based differences were detected with female students reporting lower safety levels when using buses and the subway compared to male students. Furthermore usage patterns such as hitchhiking tend to increase as students spend more time at the university and become more familiar with the available travel options.

Departmental Insights and Conclusion: Aggregated data at the department level indicates that satisfaction is heavily influenced by the physical location of buildings and proximity to transportation hubs. Departments such as Geological and Environmental Engineering reported higher satisfaction levels while those in more isolated locations showed lower scores. The results of this study emphasize that improving campus transportation requires a focus on end-to-end journey predictability and enhanced safety measures for all student groups.

Project Contributors: This research was conducted as a term project for the Department of Statistics at Middle East Technical University by Bartu Batum Cihangir Osman Dokucu Muhammet Furkan Koc and Tuna Gokyokus.
